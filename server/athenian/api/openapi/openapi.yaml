        Currently supported PR metric types.
        * `pr-wip-time`: average time spent in Work In Progress stage.
        * `pr-wip-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-wip-time`.
        * `pr-review-time`: average time spent in Review stage.
        * `pr-review-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-review-time`.
        * `pr-merging-time`: average time spent in Merge stage.
        * `pr-merging-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-merging-time`.
        * `pr-release-time`: average time spent in Release stage.
        * `pr-release-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-release-time`.
        * `pr-lead-time`: average Lead Time - time between the work started and the release.
        * `pr-lead-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-lead-time`. It should be the same as `pr-release-count`.
        * `pr-cycle-time`: Cycle Time - sum of correspodning `pr-wip-time`, `pr-review-time`, `pr-merging-time`, and `pr-release-time`.
        * `pr-cycle-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-cycle-time`. It equals to the overall number of PRs observed in the given time window.
        * `pr-all-count`: equals to the sum of `pr-cycle-count` with the number of PRs which are still not done on the specified time interval but don't have any stage-changing events. This metric should be exactly the same as the number of PRs returned by `/filter/prs`.
        * `pr-wait-first-review-time`: average time of waiting for the first review.
        * `pr-wait-first-review-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-wait-first-review`. Note: this is *not* the same as the number of PRs waiting for the first review.
        * `pr-flow-ratio`: ratio of opened to closed PRs.
        * `pr-opened`: number of opened PRs.
        * `pr-merged`: number of merged PRs.
        * `pr-rejected`: number of rejected PRs.
        * `pr-closed`: number of closed PRs.
        * `pr-released`: number of released PRs.
