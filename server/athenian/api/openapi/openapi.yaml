        * `pr-lead-count`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-lead-time` disregarding the quantiles. It should be the same as `pr-release-count`.
        * `pr-lead-count-q`: number of PRs used to calculate `pr-lead-time` after applying the quantiles.
        * `pr-cycle-time`: Cycle Time - sum of correspodning `pr-wip-time`, `pr-review-time`, `pr-merging-time`, and `pr-release-time`.
