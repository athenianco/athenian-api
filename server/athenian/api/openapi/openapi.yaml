        * `dev-review-neutrals`: how many neutral ("comment") reviews this developer submitted. One PR may have several neutral reviews by the same developer!
        * `dev-pr-comments`: how many comments (both regular and review) this developer posted.
        * `dev-regular-pr-comments`: how many regular comments (not review suggestions!) this developer posted.
        * `dev-review-pr-comments`: how many review suggestions (summaries are not considered!) this developer posted.
        * `dev-active`: indicates whether this developer has made commits on more than X days during T days. `X / T = 0.2` at the moment.
